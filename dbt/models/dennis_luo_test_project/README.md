# dennis_test_repo
 
Hey team! Here is my dbt model for GetGround challenge

You can find the code in my Github repo dennis_test_repo

Once you extracted the code please place it in your dbt folder

The folder should be dbt folder > models data logs readme > base staging entity docs > sql yml

Further details and analysis can be found in the PDF (please have a look!)

Had a great time working on this :)
